    As Team 10 (Valeh Ismayilov, Agil Mammadov, Khavar Jabbarli, Murad Taghizada) we successfully held our Hour of Code event at Baku Modern Educational Complex with 20 6-7 grade students, on 3 November, 15:00.

In our lecture, we organized things into six parts to make it easy for everyone to follow:
<br /><br />
<ol  style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px;">
  <li>1. "Biz kimik?": We kicked things off by introducing ourselves and talking about ADA University SITE and opportunities here. By considering our audience is more suitable for RFO, we explained opportunities to RFO participants at ADA University.</li>

  <li>2. "Gəlin tanış olaq”: This part was all about getting to know the participants. We wanted to learn about them and make everyone feel comfortable.</li>

  <li>3. "Proqramlaşdırma nədir?": We shared some basic info about programming and explained how we were planning to learn it during the event.</li>

  <li>4. "Code.org vaxtıdır!": This is where things got hands-on. We used Code.org to visually teach the basics of programming to all the participants.</li>

  <li>5. "Bu gün nə öyrəndik?": We went over the main things we covered during the event, making sure everyone understood the concepts.</li>

  <li>6. "Mükafat vaxtıdır!": To wrap things up, we handed out certificates to all the participants. These certificates were official ones provided by Code.org, recognizing their efforts and achievements during the event.</li>
</ol>
<br />
During our talk with the participants, we found out that many of them had experience with courses similar to ours. For example, they completed the Code.org ‘Minecraft’ course and practised using Scratch. Additionally, they shared that their school offers a special course where they learn about cool things like robotics and Arduino. It was interesting to hear about the variety of courses they have taken before and how they have explored different aspects of technology and programming. This exchange helped us understand their background and interests, providing valuable insights for tailoring our discussions and activities to better suit their experiences and knowledge.
<br /><br />
At the end of the lecture, when we asked about the lecture, the speakers said that what we talked about was super important for really getting what programming is all about. They clarified that paying attention to this particular topic is similar to taking a significant initial step for someone looking to become a programmer. They understood that getting this topic is not just helpful but super important for laying the groundwork for a good and satisfying path in programming.
<br /><br />
During our Hour of Code lecture, we focused on coaching and assisting the participants as they discovered the complexities of coding. Our responsibility was not just to supervise, but also to actively engage with the students, resolving any difficulties they experienced along the way. As we worked through the coding challenges, it became clear that many participants struggled with writing efficient code. We knew that specific requirements in the Code.org levels had to be met. Among these needs, the number of blocks emerged as a significant success element. 
<br /><br />
Surprisingly, numerous pupils ignored this criterion, frequently surpassing the required maximum by including more blocks than allowed. Despite this discrepancy, their resilience and problem-solving abilities enabled them to successfully finish the course. Notably, among the competitors, there were a few speedy finishers who not only passed the basic course but also showed exceptional skill. We expanded our assistance by providing an additional hour of code course termed 'Dance Party', allowing students an opportunity to explore and enhance their coding abilities in a more creative and dynamic atmosphere, nurture their passion and maximize their willingness to learn.
<br /><br />
Throughout the Hour of Code, we didn't run into any crucial technical problems, and that's because we made sure everything was ready beforehand. Since we were giving the lecture in Azerbaijani, we used the same language on Code.org. We smoothly completed the "Classic Maze" course, but when we switched to the "Dance Party" course, there were some issues with how things looked on the screen because of the Azerbaijani language. To solve this, we switched the language to English, and then everything worked well, and we were able to keep going with our coding activities. It was a little hiccup, but we quickly figured it out and continued having a great time coding!
<br /><br />
This is the list of what we did for preparation:
<br /><br />
<ul  style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px;">
<li>•	We created a presentation (you can access it by clicking)</li>
<li>•	We requested the required components, students from BMTK by sending the official letter and got confirmation (letter written by us) (confirmation letter by BMTK)</li>
<li>•	A full explanation paper for the “Classic Maze” course (you can access it by clicking)</li>
<li>•	Finished “Classic Maze”, “Dance Party”, and “Minecraft” (for any case) courses by ourselves</li>
<li>•	Created internal documentation to maintain the obligations of each member in the group (you can access it by clicking)</li>
<li>•	Printed certificates which are officially provided by Code.org (you can access photos by clicking)</li>
</ul>
<br />
To make things easier, we split the "Classic Maze" course into parts during our coding session. We asked the participants to wait for us to show a tutorial between each part so that everyone could follow along. Our biggest challenge came up when some students finished a bit earlier than expected, but we had a plan in place. Even though we initially decided not to move on until everyone finished a part, we realized it was better to let those who finished early continue. Once they were done, we had some other fun courses ready to go, like "Dance Party" and "Minecraft," which we had prepared in advance.
<br /><br />
We would like to thank Aysel Hasanli (director of BMTK) and the BMTK staff for their amazing help during our coding session. They provided the components we needed and professional videography/photography services. Special thanks to our team member, Agil Mammadov, for connecting us with the BMTK staff. Everything went smoothly, and we're grateful to everyone involved for making it a success!

      "Our team, Innocrew (Team 10) created our website and ready to share process with you!",

Hello everyone! As part of the Homework 3 from our Principles of Information Systems course we created this website. To create this website we had to learn basic Web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For this purpose, we finished separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses of the CodeAcademy. 
    <br /><br /> 
    These is links to our CodeAcademy achievements:
    <br /><br />
    <ul style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px;">
      <li>- <a style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank" href="https://codeacademy.com/users/valismayilov/achievements">Valeh Ismayilov</a></li>
      <li>- <a style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank" href="">Agil Mammadov</a></li>
      <li>- <a style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank" href="https://codeacademy.com/users/khavar_jabbarli971/achievements">Khavar Jabbarli</a></li> 
      <li>- <a style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank" href="">Murad Taghizada</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    In general, we have 7 HTML pages in this project, which are divided as below:
    <br /><br />
    <ul style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px;">
      <li>- index.html page</li>
      <li>- /projects pages (2)</li>
      <li>- /members pages (4)</li> 
    </ul>
    <br />
    We tried to make it as dynamic as possible. For this purpose, we created JavaScript scripts under the "scripts" folder:
    <br /><br />
    <ul style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px;">
      <li>- member.js (for /members pages) - Takes member name from URL path, maps array (members array), finds it and writes data regarding member using DOM manipulation</li>
      <li>- members.js (for index.html page) - Takes members array, maps it and appends under members container. In this case, to make the layout also dynamic we are checking the index of the array element. If it is odd, then the image of the member is rendered on the left side, if it is even, then it is rendered on the right side.</li>
      <li>- membersData.js (data) - JavaScript array file where we are storing data regarding members. Using this approach we can easily change member data without needing to edit raw HTML.</li>
      <li>- project.js (for /projects pages) - Takes project id from URL path, maps array (projects array), finds it and writes data regarding project using DOM manipulation</li>
      <li>-projects.js (for index.html page) - Takes projects array, map it and appends under projects container.</li>
      <li>- projectsData.js (data) - JavaScript array file where we are storing data regarding projects. Using this approach we can easily change project data without needing to edit raw HTML.</li>
    </ul>
