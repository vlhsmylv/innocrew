Hello! I am Valeh! Freshman IT Student at ADA University. I started to have an interest in programming 5 years ago when 3 SITE students from ADA University came to my school to conduct their Hour of Code event. After this event, I started to understand programming with Code.org. After finishing a couple of courses in Code.org I started to dive into the Web Development world. After learning basic HTML, CSS, and JS, I switched to Python to understand programming principles deeply. After learning the syntax/semantics of several programming languages, switched to Web Development again. In 2020, when there was a pandemic, I started to develop myself in this field and learned more about Web Development. In 2021, I started ADA School. During this two-year journey, I developed myself more and learned modern Web technologies such as ReactJs, NodeJs, TailwindCSS, etc. During that time I also created my community named Bitlio (helping people to learn programming in Azerbaijani) and local agency Lightbox (a digital agency that offers web apps and websites). Finally, in 2023 I started at ADA University as a Freshman IT student. Joining different internal and external organizations, challenges, etc. was my mission when I applied to this university. Parallelly with the university, I started to dive into the startup world with SABAH.incubation and formed a team with my former Chemistry teacher. Currently, I am CTO at this local startup and developing a full-stack web application of Tabiat. After a while, I also joined the Apollo Club team which seeks to encourage ADA students into the Startup world. That's my journey so far :)

    content: `Hello! I am Agil Mammadov! Freshman CE student at ADA University. I have always had a big interest in technology but I only spent so much time doing the coding stuff today. Since my childhood, Also whenI always approximately 14 years old student from ADA came to my school (Baku Modern International School) and taught us the code academy. Since then My interest in coding has risen and this year and my team I went there and taught code academy for 6th graders. I always wondered how are these sites and programs being created until I did some research and started doing the HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have a big interest in programming and that is why I already have registered for Python courses. CSS is one of the main programming languages because I will need it when creating the description and design etc. During my school years, we had free programming lessons and I decided to join. I gained a lot of knowledge and experience from that course. We had 2 times a lesson per week and I took that course for over 4 months. I did learn a lot of new stuff which is why doing HTML and CSS was a bit easy for me to do. My dad always encouraged and motivated me to study engineering and now we have decided to take Python courses. I also would like in the future to be the CEO of big companies and create my own websites and be very famous for that. My biggest dream was to study Engineering and to my luck, I am studying at the best university in Azerbaijan. Currently, I am studying Electronics and Electrical engineering at ADA University. Doing these programming lessons in info system lessons increases my interest and makes me learn it better because I am sure that I am going to need it in the future.`,

      "Hello! My name is Khavar! ADA University's first-year computer science student.  I became interested in programming after learning fundamental concepts in school, such as Alplogo and Scratch. I did a training course where I learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. Following that, I supplemented my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by enrolling in various CodeAcademy classes. Following that, I am taking CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course, which helps me to broaden my expertise. With my programming study at ADA University, I am now learning C and C++ (in 2023) as programming languages. That concludes my quick journey :)",

      "Hello! I am Murad Taghizada! Freshman CS student at ADA University. I started to show a big interest in web programming 3 years ago when my relatives who study at ADA University advised me:‚Äù Our modern world is improving day by day, and for this reason world demands us to learn information technologies, principles of computers, and programming. After this advice, I started to research computers and other information technologies. I decided to start learning web programming and I chose to learn C# programming language. I studied a CodeAcademy course, and in this period I acquired a significant number of acknowledges. Firstly, I learned primary algorithms which are the main part of every information technology. Then, after these lessons, I started to acquire a lot of techniques, skills, and knowledge which are about C# programming language. We can not illustrate programming without the Data; therefore; I  acquired acknowledges of Data and Database Management Systems (SQL, NoSQL, MSSQL). This knowledge especially is related to the Backend System. We can not imagine websites without any design, or page description. Also, I decided to learn about HTML, JS, and CSS which are essential for page description, design, and other page functions. After 6 months, I felt unusual because of getting a lot of skills, techniques, and knowledge. It was sufficient for me; therefore; I wanted to learn about a type of client-server relation which is called. API and MVC are fundamental concepts in software development and are used particularly in web applications. When I finished this course, I had a big goal to enter ADA university and study in Computer Science class. I already entered ADA university, and I started to research deeply this science. We know, our country and our world is developing day by day and increasing demands for using information technologies, programing principles, and other in all sectors. Now my goal is to show high performance in this profession and get important knowledge.",
